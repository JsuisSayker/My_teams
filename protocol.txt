EPITECH myTeams Protocol

In this program we use the TCP protocol.

The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a set of rules that ensures reliable data transmission over a computer network.
It divides data into segments, ensures their delivery in the correct order, controls the flow of data to avoid congestion,
establishes and terminates connections between devices, and adjusts the sending rate in case of congestion.
In short, TCP ensures stable and efficient communication between connected devices on the Internet.

The server reply is defined to contain the 3-digit code, followed by Space <SP>, followed by one line of text, and terminated by our end-of-line code <BELLF>.

Example :

-> /login <SP> Username <BELLF>
<- 200 <SP> Logged in. <BELLF>

-> : Request command from client to server
<- : Reply from server to client
